# Project title: Exploratory Analysis for Instacart

## Description

Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place a grocery order and have it delivered to them, similar to how Uber Eats and Door Dash work. This particular dataset was publicly released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition. Although the original dataset is no longer available on the Instacart website, Iâ€™ve created CSV files that contain a modified version of that data.

The mission is to clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.
